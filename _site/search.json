Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the program will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.\n\n        It will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.\n\n        Participation is limited to 40 people, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages.\n    \n\n    \n        Summer School Aims\n        \n            Equip participants with conceptual and methodological tools to understand, model, communicate, and act on uncertainty in relation to possible futures.\n            Foster interdisciplinary dialogue, networks, and collaborations among PGRs, ECRs, and faculty.\n            Trial creative and participatory approaches—such as storytelling, speculative design, and signal sharing—for engaging with uncertainty in research and practice.\n            Generate tangible outputs, including collaborative research proposals and think pieces on emerging issues.\n            Build long-term capacity for interdisciplinary, uncertainty & futures-oriented research across diverse fields.\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        What to Expect\n\n        The six-day international programme comprises five intensive workshop days (09:00-16:00 daily) and a field excursion in Wales.

Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the program will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.\n\n        It will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.\n\n        Participation is limited to 40 people, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages.\n    \n\n    \n        Summer School Aims\n        \n            Equip participants with conceptual and methodological tools to understand, model, communicate, and act on uncertainty in relation to possible futures.\n            Foster interdisciplinary dialogue, networks, and collaborations among PGRs, ECRs, and faculty.\n            Trial creative and participatory approaches—such as storytelling, speculative design, and signal sharing—for engaging with uncertainty in research and practice.\n            Generate tangible outputs, including collaborative research proposals and think pieces on emerging issues.\n            Build long-term capacity for interdisciplinary, uncertainty & futures-oriented research across diverse fields."

By integrating probabilistic forecasting with inventory optimization, I aim to create a novel approach that accounts for uncertainties, poor data quality, and local demand variations. This interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with scholars from Cardiff Business School, the School of Computer Science & Informatics, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the program will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.\nIt will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.\nParticipation is limited to 40 people, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages."
