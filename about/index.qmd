        <h2>About the Summer School</h2>

        <p>Questions of uncertainty and the future have been relevant throughout history, remain pressing today, and will continue to be so for generations to come. We live in an era of rapid change and pervasive uncertainty. Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the summer school will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.</p>

        <p>It will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.</p>

        <p><strong>Participation is limited to 40 people</strong>, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages.</p>
        
        <p>Various interdisicplainairy topcis will be covered incluidng but not limited to the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantifying uncertainty</li>
            <li>Communicating and Visualising Uncertainty</li>
