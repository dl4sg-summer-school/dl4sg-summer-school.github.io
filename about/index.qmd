        <h2>About the Summer School</h2>

        <p>The Art and Science of Uncertainty – An Interdisciplinary Summer School will convene participants from diverse fields to explore how uncertainty shapes knowledge, practice, and imagination. Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the program will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.</p>

        <p>It will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.</p>

        <p><strong>Participation is limited to 40 people</strong>, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages.</p>
