    "text": "About the Summer School\n\n        The Art and Science of Uncertainty – An Interdisciplinary Summer School will convene participants from diverse fields to explore how uncertainty shapes knowledge, practice, and imagination. Through keynotes, research spotlights, workshops, tutorials, and collaborative projects, the program will provide conceptual, methodological, and creative tools to understand, model, communicate, and act in the face of uncertainty—transforming it into a source of creativity and innovation for building more resilient futures.\n\n        It will also feature policy dialogues with practitioners and a field trip in Wales, linking theory to lived experiences of uncertainty. A cohort of forty PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career academics, and practitioners will be selected through a competitive application process to ensure disciplinary diversity and breadth of perspectives.\n\n        Participation is limited to 30 people, and applications will be assessed to ensure balance across disciplines, geographies, and career stages.\n        \n        Various interdisicplainairy topcis will be covered incluidng but not limited to the following topics:\n        \n            Equip participants with conceptual and methodological tools to understand, model, communicate, and act on uncertainty in relation to possible futures.\n            Quantifying uncertainty\n            Communicating and visualising uncertainty\n            Epistemologies of Uncertainty\n            Uncertainty, History and the Future\n            Uncertainty in Complex Systems\n            Uncertainty, and forecasting\n            Uncertainty, and foresight\n            Decision-Making under Uncertainty\n            Uncertainty, and participatory & co-creative approaches\n            Uncertainty, emerging issues and signal sharing\n            Uncertainty, policy and practice interfaces\n            Uncertainty & interdisciplinary collaboration\n            Uncertainty, responsibility & ethics\n            Uncertainty, resilience, and antifragility\n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Summer School Aims\n        \n            Equip participants with conceptual and methodological tools to understand, model, communicate, and act on uncertainty in relation to possible futures.\n            Foster interdisciplinary dialogue, networks, and collaborations among PGRs, ECRs, and faculty.\n            Trial creative and participatory approaches—such as storytelling, speculative design, and signal sharing—for engaging with uncertainty in research and practice.\n            Generate tangible outputs, including collaborative research proposals and think pieces on emerging issues.\n            Build long-term capacity for interdisciplinary, uncertainty & futures-oriented research across diverse fields.\n        \n    \n    \n    \n        What to Expect\n\n        The six-day international programme comprises five intensive workshop days (09:00-16:00 daily) and a field excursion in Wales. The structure will combine training, dialogue, and experimentation:\n        \n        \n            Thematic Keynotes from leading scholars and practitioners.\n            Research Spotlights where PhDs and ECRs present their work.\n            Workshops & Tutorials on probabilistic modelling, scenario planning, foresight, and speculative futures.\n            Interdisciplinary Case Studies on challenges like climate adaptation or AI governance.\n            Creativity Sessions using improvisation, art, storytelling, and signal sharing.\n            Ethics & Policy Dialogues connecting research to government and industry.\n            Day 6 Excursion in Wales for site visits and outdoor reflection.\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Who Should Apply\n        The summer school is aimed at PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, practitioners, and early-career academics from across disciplines. The cohort will consist of up to 30 participants, selected to ensure diversity and depth of engagement.\n        \n        To strengthen local capacity, around one-third of places will be reserved for Cardiff postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and early career researchers (ECRs), while international recruitment will ensure broad cross-cultural exchange. Participants will also connect with the Hwb Dyfodol network of futures practitioners in Wales."
